converting into oops:

1. let cart => 
const cart =  {
	cartItems: undefined;
}
(we have named the entire object as cart , that is why the let cart variable is renamed as cartItems)

2. export function addToCart() =>
addToCart()
(we dont write export function)

3. for accessing any cart variable or function that is inside object eg.
cart.push=>
cart.cartItems.push  (but it can be that when we use this object outside somewhere else, we dont pass the parameter as the name cart.. that's why we use 'this')=>
this.cartItems.push

4. Calling a function outside the object eg.
loadFromStorage()=>
cart.loadFromStorage()

5. importing oops file
import '../../data/cart-oops.js'
(no import x from y)

6. why oops-> represents just like real world objects
		   -> simple to manage

7. function- methods
   variables- properties
   each object that we generate from a class, is called instance of a class (read point 8)

8. to create multiple objects of the same type like-> normal cart and busniess cart, we use:
		   -> functions
		   -> classes  (Do not have parameters if its not a constructor I guess)
	the name of the functions and classes start with pascal case => (PascalCase)
